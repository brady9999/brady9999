Hi, I'm Brady I go to a technical vocational school called Pembina Trails Early College (PTEC) for short.
The coding languages that I've been taught are HTML, CSS, Python, C#, and Javascript.
Currently, I've been working on my version of J.A.R.V.I.S from Ironman named W.A.L.T.E.R, I hope to have him finished by the time I graduate high school in 2025.
Something I am interested in is game development and cybersecurity.
